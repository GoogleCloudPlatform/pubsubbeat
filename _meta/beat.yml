################### Pubsubbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Pubsubbeat ######################################

pubsubbeat:
  # The service account or refresh token JSON credentials file to use
  # to authenticate API calls.
  #
  # If you don't specify a credentials file, this Beat will use a
  # strategy called Application Default Credentials (ADC) to find your
  # application's credentials. If your Beat runs on Google Cloud Platform,
  # this strategy is recommended.
  #
  # To learn more about ADC:
  # - https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production
  credentials_file:

  # The GCP project ID with your Pub/Sub topic
  project_id: my-gcp-project

  # The Pub/Sub topic name. You must first create this topic.
  topic: my-topic

  subscription:
    # The Pub/Sub subscription name. If the subscription does not exist,
    # Pubsubbeat will attempt to create the subscription.
    name: my-subscription

    # The settings below are used only if the Beat creates the subscription.

    # Whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, acknowledged messages
    # will not be expunged until they fall out of the RetentionDuration window.
    retain_acked_messages: false

    # How long to retain messages in backlog, from the time of publish. If
    # retain_acked_messages is true, this duration affects the retention of
    # acknowledged messages, otherwise only unacknowledged messages are retained.
    # Cannot be longer than 7 days or shorter than 10 minutes.
    # Valid time units are "m" and "h". You can also compose them: "2h30m".
    retention_duration: 168h # Defaults to 7 days
